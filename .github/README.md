# Stopwatch
 This is a stopwatch widget for recording times (useful for running or other timed activities). Features will include:\
 -Running time\
 -Start, Pause, Reset, and Save buttons\
 -A list of times, with the personal record (PR) highlighted\
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* each time record will have a delete button, and a date stamp (and maybe a user-input note)\
 
 The list of times is currently stored only in the state variable. Potential improvements could involve persistent storage of saved times in the users local storage.
