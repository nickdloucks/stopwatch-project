WORKING:
buttons can set "running" properly,
clockTick works now
timer string displays time properly when parsing total seconds to digital clock fromat ("00:00:00")
reset button resets time to 0
save button appends to saved array


PROBLEMS:
the saved array does populate with a value when a time has run and is saved
    -need to handle edge case: save pushed before time is started or stopped
    -should <reset> button set <state.time> to zero AND start new time running?
componentDidUpdate increments time-elapsed, but Timer component doesn't display anything besides 00:00:00
    -not sure why an indirect call to setState (via waitASec) caused stack overflow...

POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS:



IDEAS:
    -add lap function? maybe after everything else is functioning
        -will need a lap button and new handler function
        -Timer will need to keep track of multiple times to be able to save
            -or just add lap component, and timer only keeps track of total time
