WORKING:
buttons can set "running" properly,
timer string displays time properly when parsing total seconds to digital clock fromat ("00:00:00")
reset button resets time to 0
save button appends to saved array


PROBLEMS:
increment time count of seconds (*CURRENTLY only increments once: loop NOT working)
    -something is probably off in the <while> condition of <do{}while()> in <handleClocktick>
the saved array does populate with a value when a time has run and is saved
    -need to handle edge case: save pushed before time is started or stopped
    -should reset BOTH set to zero AND start new time running?

POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS:
use generator function instead of while loop, and <yield> updated timeElapsed while <running> is true


IDEAS:
    -add lap function? maybe after everything else is functioning
