WORKING:
buttons can set "running" properly,
timer string displays time properly when parsing total seconds to digital clock fromat ("00:00:00")
reset button resets time to 0
save button appends to saved array


PROBLEMS:
increment time count of seconds (*CURRENTLY only increments once: loop NOT working)
    -something is probably off in the <while> condition of <do{}while()> in <handleClocktick>
the saved array does populate with a value when a time has run and is saved
    -need to handle edge case: save pushed before time is started or stopped
    -should reset BOTH set to zero AND start new time running?
calling waitASec asynchronously inside render caused time elapsed to update way too quickly, 
    and continued to update after running was set to false (because the execution of the async function was
    designed to happen .99 seconds later)
    -need to stop counting immediately after stop button clicked w/o causing stack overflow
    -stack overflow happened when setState was called directly in render().
    -not sure why an indirect call to setState (via waitASec) caused stack overflow...

POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS:
use generator function instead of while loop, and <yield> updated timeElapsed while <running> is true


IDEAS:
    -add lap function? maybe after everything else is functioning
