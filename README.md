# stopwatch-project
 This will be a stopwatch app for recording times (useful for running or other timed activities). Features will include:\
 -running time\
 -Start, Stop, Reset, and Save buttons\
 -a list of times, with the personal record (PR) highlighted\
   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* each time record will have a delete button, and a date stamp (and maybe a user-input note)\
 -for now, the list of times will be stored in localStorage\
